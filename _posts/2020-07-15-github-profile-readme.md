GitHub is important for your career. You know It's like your public portfolio. The question is how
to make it stand out? Luckily, GitHub released a pretty cool feature, and in this quick tip, we will
see how to use it.

So, as we already said, GitHub recently released a new feature that can make your profile stand out,
or at least look a bit more personalized. All you need to do is to create a profile-level README
file, and GitHub will display it on top of your page.

## Why README

We all know how important READMEs are for documenting every project. It's often the border between
working alone and finding contributors.  I think using README for _documenting_ people is a great
idea.

But why do we need README when we can just write a short bio? Well, Markdown is more flexible - we
can place links, images, or even GIFs. README also takes more space in the centre of people's
screens. With all that freedom and space awesome people can make awesome things.

## How-To

Enough talking, let's see how to beautify our profiles. It's fast, and you can do it in three easy
steps:
1. Go to https://github.com/new and create a repository with the same name (including casing) as
your GitHub username
2. Create a `README.md` file and add your fancy code there
3. Commit (and push)

absolute_url }}) _Creating a new repository_

What if you already have a repository with the same name? I'd recommend renaming the existing
project, or if possible, changing the content of the README file.

## Inspiration

My profile README is relatively simple. You can see how it looks like at the time of this writing at
the top of the post or check it at [GitHub](https://github.com/ivanovyordan/).

Of course, you may have better ideas like placing animated portraits, skill endorsements or even the
tracks that you are listening in Spotify. You can find all this and even more in a [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme).

I showed you mine, now it's your turn to show me yours.
