                <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Yordan ðŸ‘‹.</p>
                <p>As a Head of Data Engineering, I lead a brilliant team of data and analytics engineers. Together, we build systems that keep the business informed, fast-moving, and resilient. I care deeply about creating an environment where engineers thrive and data drives real outcomes.</p>
                <p>My background spans 15 years across techâ€”from early-stage startups to global companies. That journey taught me how to scale teams, untangle complexity, and deliver value through thoughtful engineering.</p>
                <p>Iâ€™ve had the chance to mentor dozens of professionalsâ€”software engineers, data engineers, analysts, and more. I help them grow across three key areas:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>ðŸ§  Technical depth</li>
                    <li>ðŸ’¬ Communication and influence</li>
                    <li>ðŸŽ¯ Leadership and decision-making</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Mentorship has become one of the most rewarding parts of my career.</p>
                <p>These days, I share what Iâ€™ve learned through my newsletter and on LinkedIn. I write about data leadership, team dynamics, and lessons from the field. And I get to connect with loads of friendly, curious people doing great things in tech.</p>
                <p>Youâ€™re always welcome to reach outâ€”whether you want to chat about software, business, data, or anything nerdy.</p>
                <p>Letâ€™s connect.</p>
