            You're a data leader. But lately, it doesn't feel like you're
            leading.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your team is stuck in reactive mode. Stakeholders don't really adopt
            what you build. You spend more time decoding vague requests than
            doing impactful work.
          </p>
          <p>
            You've tried building cleaner dashboards, faster pipelines, better
            documentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            But nothing changes—because
            <strong>the real problem isn't technical. It's relational</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's the <strong>trust gap</strong> between your team and the
            business.
