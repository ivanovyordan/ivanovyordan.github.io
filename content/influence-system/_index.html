    <h2>When Great Work Doesn't Get You Noticed</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div>
        <p>You know you are doing great work. And yet, something still isn't clicking.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>❌ Stakeholders loop you in after they've already made key decisions.</li>
            <li>❌ You spend more time reacting to "urgent" requests than doing strategic work.</li>
            <li>❌ You sit through meetings thinking, <i>"Why are we even doing this?"</i></li>
            <li>❌ Your team quietly delivers — but no one seems to notice.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>You're not alone. And you're not imagining it.</p>
        <p>Because here's the truth: <b>doing great work isn't enough.</b></p>
        <p>Not if you want your team to be seen as more than a service desk.</p>
        <p>And it's not your fault. No one teaches data leaders how to lead people who don't speak data.</p>

    <h2>The Cost of Being Overlooked</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div>
        <p>This gap between you and your stakeholders is quietly <u>eroding everything</u> you care about.</p>
        <p><b>It kills morale</b> — your team feels like ticket-takers.</p>
        <p><b>It wastes time</b> — work gets redone, thrown out, or ignored.</p>
        <p><b>It blocks your growth</b> — you’re stuck being useful but not trusted.</p>
        <p>And it gets worse:</p>
        <p>Every week that passes without addressing this, the story becomes more ingrained.</p>
        <blockquote>
          “The data team is helpful, but not strategic.”<br/>
          “They’re smart, but don’t really get the business.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>You know that’s not true. But unless something changes, that’s how you’ll keep being perceived.</p>
        <p>And in your gut, you already know: <b>the way forward isn’t more dashboards.</b></p>

          <li>🛡️ Say "no" (or "not yet") without damaging relationships</li>
          <li>🎟️ Get invited early to strategic planning, not added as an afterthought</li>
          <li>🤝 Shift how the business sees you — from support to partner</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This isn’t <u>wishful thinking</u>. It’s a <u>skillset</u>.</p>
