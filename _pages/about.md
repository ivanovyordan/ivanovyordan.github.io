Hey, My name is Yordan.

I'm a software developer, open source enthusiast, a Linux user and a gamer. My interests include politics, drinking beer and arguing.

If you’d like to get in touch, you can look me up on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{  site.author.twitter  }}) and
[GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}), or [message me directly]({% link _pages/contact.html %})

Oh, I almost forgot about that! I have a wife and two daughters.
