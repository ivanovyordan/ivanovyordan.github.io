Hi, I’m Yordan - a Jack of all trades, master of some. I help people make sense of data without the need for them to think about processes. I wrote my first line of code nearly 20 years ago and worked in IT for more than 10 years.

I share stories and thoughts about technologies, people, productivity and management.

I started coding at school back in 2003 but found my passion in programming about two years later. That's when I started modding my favourite game at that time, Counter-Strike. Those blood effects I added was sick.

I landed my first programming job in 2010 in a small company of two engineers and one graphical designer. For the short time I stayed there we developed one web-based game from start to end. We also finished another started by an external company. We developed quite a few websites, some of them still are alive and with their original design. That’s also when my first daughter was born and I got my Bachelor’s degree.

Next was my job at a [StreamingVideoProvider](https://www.streamingvideoprovider.com/). The team there was much larger - four engineers and a designer. It’s unbelievable how much we achieved for the six years I stayed there. I worked on every corner of the service - infrastructure, streaming, IoT hardware, back-end and front-end. I’m particularly proud of how quick and flexible the video player is. I’m even prouder with the change of mindset and processes I brought when we switched from SVN to Git. Aside from research and development, my main task was onboarding and levelling up every new hire. I developed a process to help a couple of my colleagues to move from trainee to completely independent in a few months. It’s great to see some of them, leading teams now. During my time there, my second daughter was born and I got my MCS degree.

After that, I joined [Dext](https://dext.com/) (Receipt Bank back then). This is the largest company I’ve worked for so far. When I joined we were less than 200 people and I was the only data engineer. I was working on an already started Proof of Concept project with PySpark. The project gained popularity within the company. Soon every department wanted to use these sweet dashboards. The company grew to more than 500 people, but the team to two DEs. We started with a couple of gigs of data and now store hundreds of terabytes of it. We had to revisit tooling and processes while ensuring our data is secure, reliable and up-to-date. Aside from the technical challenges,  I learned how to work remotely, communicate effectively, and think more strategically. My family and I moved to our house in the countryside which we built from scratch. Also, our third daughter was born.

Apart from my career and life, I’m part of a small non-profit. We organise free events dedicated to open-source software and hardware. Our main event is an annual conference in Plovdiv, Bulgaria but my favourites are the workshops for kids.

That’s who I am, a tech-savvy nerd, hard worker, lifelong learner, husband and father of three wonderful girls. How do I manage to balance all that? I live on the edge of burnout. Well, that’s not entirely true, I’m actually obsessed with productivity. I also game a lot.
