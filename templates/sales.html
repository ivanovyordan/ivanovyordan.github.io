          You're a data leader. But lately, it doesn't feel like you're leading.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your team is stuck in reactive mode. Stakeholders don't really adopt
          what you build. You spend more time decoding vague requests than doing
          impactful work.
        </p>
        <p>
          You've tried building cleaner dashboards, faster pipelines, better
          documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          But nothing changes‚Äîbecause
          <strong>the real problem isn't technical. It's relational</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's the <strong>trust gap</strong> between your team and the
          business.
